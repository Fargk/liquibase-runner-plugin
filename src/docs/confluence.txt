{excerpt}Provides [Liquibase|http://www.liquibase.org] build steps that perform liquibase operations.{excerpt}

h2. Features

Adds liquibase changeset evaluation as an available build step. See Liquibase documentation at [http://www.liquibase.org].  In addition, supplies a build step to roll back applied changesets.
Any evaluated changesets are listed on the build's summary page, as well as details about each changeset (including the SQL used to apply the changeset).

Uses liquibase version 3.5.1.

h2. Installation

* Install the liquibase-runner plugin using Jenkins' plugin manager. Depending on how you use and configure the plugin,
you may need to install a database server, and potentially your target schema.

* Once installed, two build steps are made available: "Evaluate liquibase changesets" and "Rollback liquibase changes".

h2. Common Configuration

h3. Simplest

By default, the plugin will use an instance of an H2 in-memory database, so you need only define the location of your changeset file.   Note that changes won't be persisted across builds (though you may persist the H2 database to disk, see tips).

h3. Advanced

Those who would like more control over liquibase configuration may do so using options presented when using the "advanced"
section of the builder configuration. Here you'll find most of liquibase's configuration exposed, including contexts and
the JDBC URL used to access the database.

For convenience, the plugin includes a few database drivers for use. Alternatively, you may
also define a classpath where a database driver may be loaded, and the driver classname.

Note that individual configuration values will override any found in a defined liquibase properties file.  This emulates how command-line usage of liquibase works.

h2. Evaluate liquibase changesets step

Creating a job with this build step will run liquibase's update on the target database.  Alternatively, by checking "Test Rollbacks", liquibase's updateTestingRollbacks is executed.  Once a build has executed, details are provided about each changeset on the build summary.

h2. Rollback liquibase changes step

The rollback build step invokes liquibase's "rollback" operation on the target database.  There are a few rollback strategies to choose from that correspond to liquibase's rollback commands (by tag, by date, and by count).

This build step is intended for use when you're deploying to a real environment, and the need arises to undo a previous liquibase update.

h2. Pipeline Support

Both the plugin's update and rollback operations are available to pipline scripts.  To evaulate changesets, the syntax
is as follows:

liquibaseUpdate()

Parameters include testRollbacks, tagOnSuccessfulBuild, and dropAll.

Roll back operations may be done thusly:

liquibasaeRollback()

Parameters include:

Common to each operation are the following parameters:


h2. Usage Tips

* If you'd like to have only new changesets evaluated, consider using an H2 JDBC url like
"jdbc:h2:[file:./data/sample]". This instructs H2 to persist the database to a file. Note, however, if a different
build slave runs your project, that file will no longer be available, and all changesets will again be executed.
