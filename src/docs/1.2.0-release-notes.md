# 1.2.0 Release notes

**Important**
This version now uses the [Credentials Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Plugin) to manage usernames and passwords to connect to the database.  If you were using username & password configuration in the previous version of this plugin, it will be necessary to redefine them using the credentials configuration.
